Bugs fixed
==========

 |Percona XtraBackup| would crash when being prepared if the index compaction
 was enabled. Bug fixed :bug:`1192834`.

 Fixed build failure on *Debian Stretch* by adding support for building with
 *OpenSSL* 1.1. Bug fixed :bug:`1678947`.

 |xbstream| could run out of file descriptors while extracting the backup
 which contains many tables. Bug fixed :bug:`1690823`.

 |Percona XtraBackup| incorrectly determined use of ``master_auto_postion``
 on a slave, and thus generated invalid :file:`xtrabackup_slave_info` file.
 Bug fixed :bug:`1705193`.

 ``--ftwrl-*`` options. Bug fixed :bug:`1704636`.
