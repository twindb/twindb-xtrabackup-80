|percona| is glad to announce the release of |pxb.name| |release| on |date|.
Downloads are available from our `download site
<http://www.percona.com/downloads/XtraBackup/Percona-XtraBackup-8.0.4/>`_ and
from :ref:`apt <apt_repo>` and :ref:`yum <yum_repo>` repositories.

|Percona XtraBackup| enables MySQL backups without blocking user queries, making
it ideal for companies with large data sets and mission-critical applications
that cannot tolerate long periods of downtime. Offered free as an open source
solution, it drives down backup costs while providing unique features for
|MySQL| backups.

This release of Percona Xtrabackup is a **General Availability** release ready
for use in a production environment.

.. rubric:: Please note the following about this release:

- The deprecated innobackupex has been removed. Use the xtrabackup command to
  back up your instances: ``$ xtrabackup --backup --target-dir=/data/backup``
- When migrating from earlier database server versions, `backup and restore and
  using Percona XtraBackup 2.4
  <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-xtrabackup/2.4/how-tos.html#recipes-for-xtrabackup>`_
  and then use ``mysql_upgrade`` from |MySQL| 8.0.x
- If using ``yum`` or ``apt`` repositories to install |Percona Xtrabackup| |release|, ensure
  that you have enabled the new `tools` repository. You can do this with the
  :program:`percona-release enable tools release` command and then install the
  `percona-xtrabackup-80` package.

All Percona software is open-source and free. We are grateful to the community
for the invaluable contributions to |Percona XtraBackup|. We would especially
like to highlight the input of *Alexey Kopytov* who has been actively offering
improvements and submitting bug reports for |Percona XtraBackup|.
