Make a Streaming Backup
================================================================================

Stream mode sends the backup to ``STDOUT`` in the ``xbstream`` format instead of
copying it to the directory named by the first argument. You can pipe the output
to a local file, or, across the network, to another server.

To extract the resulting ``xbstream`` file, you **must** use the ``xbstream``
utility.
